## About Me

My life is about creating, blogging and talking about [digital health and patient UX](https://healthinnovation.kaiserpermanente.org).
I'm a fan of happiness design, visual communications, language and baking.
Much of my spare time is spent fighting cancer, both for me and others in need.

## My Work
I share simple projects that should be open to all.
Everything here is simple because I'm a pretty basic programmer.
My friends and colleagues refer to me as “Aaron the Side of Caution.”

## Contact
If you'd like to contact me, I'd love to hear from you at [@aaronjlee](https://twitter.com/aaronjlee).
